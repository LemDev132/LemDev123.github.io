<h3>Privacy Policy for NeuroQuest: Goals & Habits</h3>
<p><strong>Effective Date: August 1, 2025</strong></p>

<h3>1. Introduction</h3>
<p>Welcome to NeuroQuest: Goals & Habits ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled. Your privacy is critically important to us. The core principle of our App is that your data is your own. We do not collect, store, or have access to any of your personal data.</p>

<h3>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h3>
<p>We want to be crystal clear: We do not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal information from you. All data generated by your use of the App is stored exclusively on your own device. We, the developers, have no access to it.</p>
<p>This means we do not collect:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Your name, email address, or other contact information.</li>
    <li>Device identifiers or location data.</li>
    <li>Any of the usage data or statistics you generate within the App.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Information Your Device Stores Locally</h3>
<p>The App needs to store some data on your device to function correctly. This data is created by you and for you, and it never leaves your device. This locally stored data includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A history of your completed habits and the dates they were completed.</li>
    <li>Your all-time highest streak for each habit.</li>
    <li>Your current, ongoing streak for each habit.</li>
</ul>
<p>This information is stored in the App's private directory on your device and is essential for tracking your progress.</p>

<h3>4. How to Delete Your Data</h3>
<p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control. To permanently delete all data associated with the App, you simply need to uninstall the App from your device. This action will remove the App and all its stored data.</p>

<h3>5. Third-Party Services</h3>
<p>NeuroQuest: Goals & Habits does not integrate with any third-party services that would collect data from you.</p>

<h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
<p>Our App is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. Since we do not collect any data in the first place, we do not have any information about the age of our users.</p>

<h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
